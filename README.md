# About Me
## My Hobbies
I have been building computers for about 14 years now! I developed the interest in the first place from watching my dad rebuild his desktops when I was a child and it stuck with me when the time came to pull apart my first computer. Coincidentally my personal computer has grown increasingly more absurd over the years.

I also enjoy gardening in my free time and always try to keep [something seasonal](https://ncfieldfamily.org/food/whats-season-north-carolina-produce-calendar/) growing!
## Websites I Recommend
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a free resource for learning and refining coding skills. The website offers a large variety of courses to choose from and allows users to test their code in a web-based text editor. W3schools also offers certificate programs to help further master and market your coding abilities.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), like W3schools, is another resource for developing coding skills. While Codecademy focuses on a narrower range of languages its courses have a distinct hands-on feel that is otherwise lacking from W3schools. As such, using both of these sites complimentary to one another avails more than enough information to get started learning how to code.
