	  <h1>My name is Gabriel</h1>
	  <p>I am a career barista and aspiring IT professional! Some of my favorite things I've gotten to learn about this semester are desktop virtualization and GIT. When I have free time I enjoy gardening, listening to and playing music, and leisurely driving my car. I am also in the process of picking up baking!</p>
